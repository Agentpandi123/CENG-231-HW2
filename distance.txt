The program distance.c is meant to computes the sum of two non-negative integer distances. The program should prompt for the distances in miles, yards, feet, and inches for 2 distance values, then display the 
results. In addition, display each summed distance after it has been entered.  To do this, I first asked the user for the inputs for the first set of distance.  This includes the inches, feet, yards, and miles.  
I then made sure that each number was divided by a number that made it less than the measured unit.  For example, if the inches was more than 12, I would use modulo so that it got the correct amount of inches afterits conveted into feet.  I had done this for each unit and then print the first distance.  I then copied this code to ask the second set of units and print that as well.  Then I added everything and converted it 
into inches and to get the total miles, yards, feet, and inches all I had to do was divide by the conversion rate.  Finally, I print the total distance.
